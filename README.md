Abstract

Objective: Dried Blood Spots (DBS) are broadly used for different serological analyses, including SARS-CoV-2 antibody assessment. In order to biobank DBS samples, understanding of the preservation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is needed. Therefore, we assessed the stability of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on DBS during short- and long-term storage under different storage temperatures.
Methods: Seven sample donors were enrolled, each donating twenty 6-mm DBS to assess anti-spike (S1) SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (EUROIMMUN). Baseline samples were analyzed on the day of collection. The remainder of samples was stored in grip seal bags, kept in a cryobox at room temperature/4°C until 2 months after collection and at -20°C until 2 years after collection. Samples were analyzed at regular intervals within the total storage duration and after one and five freeze-thaw cycles. A pooled coefficient of variation was calculated for each storage temperature.
Results:
Anti-S1 SARS-CoV-2 antibodies collected on DBS saver cards remain stable during short-term storage at RT, 4°C and -20°C (at least to two months) and long-term storage at -20°C (at least two years). Moreover, up to five freeze-thaw cycles can occur without impacting the anti-S1 SARS-CoV-2 antibody level. The inter-assay coefficient of variation lies between 10% and 15%.
Conclusion:
As DBS can be preserved for both shorter periods of time at RT and longer periods of time at -20°C, they are a perfect application for studies that require sample shipment by mail, self-sampling studies, studies in limited resource settings and biobanking.

Importance: Dried blood spots (DBS) are currently widely used as a microsampling technique for different qualitative and quantitative serological assessments. Yet, there is a lack of long-term stability and storage condition studies. In our study, as first, we assessed the stability of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on DBS up to two years post-collection. We believe that our data are not only important for future COVID-19 research but also for studies on other infections/diseases using DBS-based serology.
